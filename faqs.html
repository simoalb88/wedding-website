            <div class="section-card">
                <h2 class="section-title">Are children allowed?</h2>
                <p>While children are not invited to the wedding celebration, we know many of you may be traveling with kids. We're happy to help coordinate childcare by sharing a list of vetted, local babysitters in the area.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section-card">
                <h2 class="section-title">Attire</h2>
                <p class="faq-subtitle">Summer Cocktail Attire</p>
                <p>Think light fabrics, warm-weather silhouettes, and shoes suitable for grass, gravel and dancing the night away.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section-card">
                <h2 class="section-title">Other Events?</h2>
                <p>At this time, we don't have any formal events planned beyond the wedding day. We'll be in town during the week of the wedding and would love to meet up if timing allows. We also encourage guests to explore, relax, and enjoy Italy and beyond at their own pace.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section-card">
                <h2 class="section-title">Transportation</h2>
                <p>We'll be providing transportation on the wedding day from Stresa to our venue and back at the end of the night. More details coming soon!</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section-card">
                <h2 class="section-title">Weather</h2>
                <p>July is typically warm, but Verbania can experience occasional rainstorms. We recommend packing light layers and being prepared for a mix of sunshine and summer showers.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section-card">
                <h2 class="section-title">Where else to explore?</h2>
                <p>Lake Maggiore stretches all the way into Switzerland and is easily accessible by car or ferry, perfect for a day trip!</p>
                <p>There's so much of Italy to explore and all spots are just a train ride or short flight away. For nearby trips, we especially recommend Cinque Terre, Santa Margherita, and Portofino for their seaside views and delicious eats.</p>
                <p>Need more ideas? Don't hesitate to reach out! We're happy to share tips, itineraries, and hidden gems to make your trip extra special.</p>
